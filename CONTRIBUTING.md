## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**Important**: By submitting a pull request or contributing code to this project, you agree to the following:

1. You grant the project maintainers (copyright holders) a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, sublicense, and relicense your contributions under any license terms they choose.

2. You confirm that you have the right to grant this license (i.e., the contribution is your original work or you have permission to contribute it).

3. Your contributions will be licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3) as part of this project.

**Why this CLA?** This allows the project maintainers to potentially offer dual-licensing in the future (e.g., a commercial license for companies that don't want AGPL terms) while keeping the open-source version free and open.
