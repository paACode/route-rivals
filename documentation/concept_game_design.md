# RouteRivals - Game Concept

RouteRivals transforms outdoor cycling into a real-time multiplayer strategy game. Teams compete on real roads using GPS-based gameplay that rewards tactical thinking and coordination - not just raw power.

## 🎮 Core Gameplay

### 🎯 Territory Control
Teams compete to capture and hold geographic checkpoints (flags) scattered across a real-world battle map. Capture a flag by staying within its radius for 45 seconds. Owned flags generate points over time.
A game ends when max points are achieved or when time is up.

**Strategic choices:**
- Which flags are worth fighting for based on terrain and routes?
- Should your team spread or keep together? (Drafting, Faster capture time,...)

### ⚔️ Elimination Mechanic
Overtake an opponent and they're temporarily eliminated - forced to respawn at their team's territory. This creates numerical advantages and adds high-stakes drama to every encounter.

**Elimination rules:**
- Safety first: Elimination in descents is not possible
- Approaching an opponent starts an attack alert on both screens (attacker and defender)
  - 30m gap triggers alert on flats
  - 10m gap triggers alert on climbs
- Overtake and maintain clean separation (30m on flats, 10m on climbs) for 30 seconds to eliminate

### 🤝 Team Tactics
Victory requires strategy and teamwork, not just fitness.

**Pre-game planning:**
- Analyze terrain: main roads, single track, gravel paths
- Identify strategic flag positions
- Anticipate opponent strategies
- Assign tactical roles

**Tactical roles:**
- **Attacker:** Hunt opponents for eliminations
- **Conqueror:** Focus on capturing and holding flags
- **Scout:** Gather intelligence while staying hidden
- **Sprinter/Climber:** Claim segments for bonus points and buffs

**🚴 Bike selection matters:**
- MTB: Access hard-to-reach flags via single track
- Road bike: Speed for eliminations and rapid transitions
- Gravel bike: Versatility for mixed terrain

## 💦 Resource System: Sweat Drops

Distance traveled earns sweat drops. Spend them on tactical abilities:

- **🚧 Roadblock:** Force opponents to find alternate routes
- **🗼 Exploration Tower:** Reveal opponent positions on the map
- **🏥 Temporary Revive Station:** Place a closer respawn point for teammates

This rewards constant movement and creates meaningful strategic choices.

## 🏆 Bonus Objectives

Secondary objectives create multiple paths to victory:

| Objective | How to Win | Reward |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| **👕 Green Jersey** | Fastest times through sprint segments | Checkpoint capture time buff |
| **⛰️ King of the Mountain** | Fastest climbing times | Bonus sweat drop generation |
| **🗺️ Exploration Waypoints** | Discover hidden locations | Bonus points |
| **💛 Cycling Passion** | Most total distance/elevation | 100 point end-game bonus |

## 🎲 Design Philosophy

- Territory control determines victory (~70% of points)
- Bonus objectives create strategic depth (~30% of points)
- Multiple viable strategies based on team composition
- Tactics and teamwork can overcome pure power differences
- Every rider type can contribute meaningfully

## ✨ Key Features

- **Real-Time Competition:** Live GPS tracking with opponents on the map (visible on own territory or within exploration towers view radius)
- **Strategic Depth:** Positioning, coordination, and timing matter
- **Safety-First:** Traffic laws always supersede game rules, audio feedback minimizes screen time, attacks trigger automatically when reaching an opponent. Skills can only be applied when stationary.
