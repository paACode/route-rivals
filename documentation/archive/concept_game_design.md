## Core Game  Dynamics

### 🎯 Territory Control
Teams compete to capture and defend geographic checkpoints scattered across a predefined battle-map. Hold strategic positions longer than your opponents to accumulate points. 

### ⚔️ Elimination Mechanic
When you overtake an opponent, they're eliminated from play and must respawn at their team's base station 

### 🤝 Team Tactics 
Victory requires more than just raw speed and performance - coordination and strategy are essential. 

Analyse the routes of the choosen battle map with your team before the race day:
- How can Checkpoints be reached? Are there many main roads , single trails or gravel paths?
- Plan your routes 
- Anticipate what your oponents strategy could be? Where could they place road blocks
- Divide tactical roles in your team: 
 "attacker": Overtake oponents to bring them home to their base station
 "conqueror": Collect those checkpoints
 "scout": trying to stay camouflaged and understand whats the oponents strategy
 "buff collector": Collect those buffs to get your team a tactical advantage
- Choose your bikes: MTB can be great to attack checkpoints from hard to control single trails. Road Bikes are great to hunt your oponents down and to fastly reach checkpoints.
Gravel bikes can be a great compromise having both from both worlds. 

### ✨ Apply Skills 
Use tactical abilities by using your teams sweat drops to disrupt your opponents strategy.

- Use roadblocks to enforce your oponents,searching alternative routes reaching the checkpoint under your Control
- Use traps that will flatten your opponents tubes, enforcing them to take a break for 1min 
- Use Ghost-Rider Attacks to make your oponnent belief they are chased to drain their energy , before you start a real attack . 
- Use exploration towers to track your oponents activities
- Place a temporary revive station in a tactical ideal place , so that your team mates do not need to go back all the way back to the base station in case they were hunted down by an oponent.
