# RouteRivals

**Where Cycling Meets Strategy**

> Transform your outdoor cycling into a real-time competitive multiplayer experience

## What is RouteRivals?

RouteRivals is a GPS-based real-time multiplayer competitive cycling game that bridges the gap between indoor virtual racing and outdoor GPS tracking. It's **Capture-the-Flag meets competitive cycling** - turning your outdoor rides into tactical battles where physical performance meets strategic gameplay.

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Conception & Planning

### The Market Gap We're Filling

- **Zwift** gives you real-time competition, but locks you indoors
- **Strava** gets you outside, but competition is asynchronous (segments)
- **RouteRivals** delivers real-time outdoor competition with tactical depth

## Core Game Modes

### 🎯 Territory Control
Teams compete to capture and defend geographic checkpoints scattered across the map. Hold strategic positions longer than your opponents to accumulate points and dominate your riding area. Territory ownership shifts dynamically as teams attack and defend in real-time.

### 🤝 Team Tactics and Skills
Victory requires more than raw speed - coordination and strategy are essential. Use tactical abilities like traps to slow opponents and much more. 
Success demands collaboration, timing, and smart resource management.

### ⚔️ Elimination Mechanic (Revive/Kill)
When you overtake an opponent, they're eliminated from play and must respawn at their team's base station - just like a shooter game. This creates high-stakes chases where positioning and drafting become crucial tactical elements. Protect your teammates and hunt down rivals to control the map.


## Secondary Objectives (Bonus Points)

### ⚡ Sprint Segments
Designated speed zones scattered across the map. The faster you blast through these segments, the more points your team earns. Risk burning matches early for points, or save your energy for objectives?

### ⛰️ King of the Hill (Climb Segments)

Timed climbing challenges on key ascents. Post the fastest time to claim maximum points for your team. Climbers can shine here while sprinters focus elsewhere - every rider type has a role.

### ️🗺 Exploration Waypoints
Discover hidden scenic viewpoints and landmarks to earn bonus points. Perfect for teams who value exploration and route knowledge. Sometimes the scenic route is the winning route.

  Game Philosophy: Core modes determine victory, but bonus objectives create strategic depth. Do you chase every sprint and climb, or focus on territory control? Balance is key.
