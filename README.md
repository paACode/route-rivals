# RouteRivals

RouteRivals transforms outdoor cycling into a real-time multiplayer strategy game. Teams compete on real roads using GPS-based gameplay that rewards tactical thinking and coordination - not just raw power.

## 🎮 Gameplay

**🎯 Territory Control:** Teams capture and hold geographic flags scattered across a real-world map. Stay within a flag's radius to capture it - owned flags generate points over time.

**⚔️ Elimination:** Overtake an opponent to temporarily eliminate them, forcing a respawn at their team's territory. Safety-first: eliminations disabled on descents.

**🤝 Team Tactics:** Pre-game planning matters. Choose tactical roles (Attacker, Conqueror, Scout, Sprinter/Climber) and bike type (MTB, Road, Gravel) based on terrain and strategy.

**💦 Sweat Drops:** Distance traveled earns resources to spend on abilities like Roadblocks, Exploration Towers, and Temporary Revive Stations.

**🏆 Bonus Objectives:** Compete for jerseys (sprint/climbing segments), discover exploration waypoints, and earn end-game bonuses for total distance/elevation.
