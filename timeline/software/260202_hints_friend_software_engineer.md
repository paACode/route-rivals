- Flutter could be a another product on the google grave yard.  not optimized for Android nor IOs
- Maybe use Cotrlin : Now also supports Multicompose , but not sure how far it is implemented
- Still develop Cotlin (fgor Android) and Swift for IOS --> but big overhead to maintain two platforms
- MAybe can also use react native?

- In general he was not sure if python is good as backend, especially if you want to run it as micro service . He said for example Go would be much nice and more performant but he does not know much about python, so maybe it is still possible. He said python as backend could be a problem if i scale up user baser. and have several 1000 active riders where i need to track their coordinates and so on in the backend.

- He also said i should have a look at firebase, its free and allows to do Notifications and also FW Updates, in general he recommends to start early with Testupdates , to see if Updating works

- In general his impression is to start early on "Mobile" i should not implement to much on Desktop, as it is easier to move mobile to Desktop then the other way round. additionally he also said then i really need to think about game design and maybe some UI that works on Desktop completeley fails on mobile

- Als recommends to play around with Flutter, React Native, Cotlin Swift with vibe Coding before i decide to a Tech stack . Simply vibe code a bit and compare the different solutions.
