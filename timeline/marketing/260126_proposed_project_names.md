# Proposed Project Names for TerraCycle

**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Purpose:** Alternative naming options for the GPS-based capture-the-flag cycling game

---

## RANKED NAME RECOMMENDATIONS

### #1: ROUTERIVALS

**Why This Name Wins:**
- **Perfect positioning blend**: "Route" speaks directly to outdoor cycling and GPS navigation, while "Rivals" immediately communicates the competitive gaming aspect
- **Category clarity**: Instantly conveys "competitive outdoor cycling" without explanation
- **Memorable and distinctive**: Easy to pronounce internationally, has rhythm and alliteration (R-R)
- **Brand personality match**: Balances the strategic/competitive nature with the cycling core - feels both playful and serious
- **No conflicts found**: Research shows no existing cycling app or major brand with this name
- **Domain potential**: RouteRivals.com and .gg appear available based on lack of web presence
- **Marketing gold**: Natural tagline extensions ("Find your route. Face your rivals." / "Every route has rivals.")

**Strategic Rationale:**
This name positions us clearly against both Zwift (we're outdoor routes, not virtual) and Strava (we're live competition, not leaderboards). It's immediately understandable while being unique enough to own.

### #2: VELOQUEST

**Why This Ranks High:**
- **Cycling heritage**: "Velo" is universally recognized cycling terminology (French for bicycle)
- **Adventure narrative**: "Quest" aligns perfectly with exploration, strategy, and gamification elements
- **Strong brand personality**: Sounds innovative and adventurous without being intimidating
- **Existing awareness**: There's a cycling event called VeloQuest, but it's NOT a commercial app or major brand - minimal conflict
- **International appeal**: Works well across languages and markets
- **Domain status**: VeloQuest.com exists as a parked/potentially available domain

**Minor Concerns:**
The existing cycling event creates some search noise, but since it's a regional physical race rather than an app, the conflict is minimal. The term "quest" is widely used in gaming, which is both good (familiar) and potentially generic.

**Strategic Rationale:**
This name leans heavily into the gaming/adventure aspect while maintaining cycling credibility. Best for positioning as "the adventure cycling game."

### #3: RIDEREALMS

**Why This Works Well:**
- **Dual meaning brilliance**: "Ride Realms" can be parsed as both "Ride + Realms" (cycling + gaming territories) and evokes "real" (outdoor, authentic)
- **Gaming vocabulary**: "Realms" is established gaming terminology for zones/territories, perfect for flag-capture mechanics
- **AR positioning**: Subtly hints at the augmented reality layer without being tech-heavy
- **No conflicts**: Zero existing brands found with this name
- **Strong brand personality**: Innovative, playful, and strategic - hits all personality marks
- **Domain availability**: Appears available based on research

**Minor Concerns:**
Less immediately "cycling" than options with Velo/Pedal/Route. "Realms" might feel slightly fantasy-adjacent (though that's actually good for the gaming audience).

**Strategic Rationale:**
Best for emphasizing the "new category" positioning - "This isn't just cycling, it's accessing new realms of outdoor gaming."

### #4: PEDALWARFARE

**Why This Has Strong Appeal:**
- **Immediately memorable**: Bold, distinctive, slightly edgy - stands out in crowded market
- **Perfect for target demo**: Appeals strongly to competitive cyclists and gamers who cycle
- **Clear competitive signal**: "Warfare" leaves zero ambiguity about the competitive nature
- **Cycling terminology**: "Pedal" is universally understood, inclusive of all cycling levels
- **No conflicts**: Research shows no existing products with this name
- **Domain availability**: Appears available

**Strategic Concerns:**
"Warfare" might be perceived as too aggressive/exclusive for the "inclusive, all levels welcome" positioning. Could deter casual/social riders who want structured activities but not combat metaphors. Less international-friendly (warfare has different connotations globally).

**Strategic Rationale:**
Best if we want to lean HARD into the competitive gaming positioning and target the serious/competitive segment first. Risks alienating the "social riders seeking structure" segment.

---

### #5: STREETFLAG

**Why This Still Works:**
- **Literal description**: Immediately communicates the core mechanic (flag capture) and outdoor setting (street/real world)
- **Simple and direct**: Two syllables, easy to say, easy to remember
- **Gaming reference**: "Flag" instantly signals capture-the-flag gameplay
- **Urban/outdoor vibe**: "Street" emphasizes real-world, outdoor, accessible
- **No conflicts**: No existing apps or brands found
- **Domain availability**: Appears available

**Why It Ranks Lower:**
- Least distinctive - more descriptive than evocative
- "Street" might limit perceived scope (what about trails, countryside, gravel routes?)
- Doesn't convey the strategic depth or "new category" innovation
- Less cycling-specific terminology compared to other options
- Slightly generic feeling

**Strategic Rationale:**
Safe, functional name that clearly describes what we do but doesn't create as much brand mystique or category differentiation. Best if absolute clarity is prioritized over distinctiveness.

## Domain Availability Summary

Based on research (as of January 26, 2026):
- **RouteRivals**: No web presence found - likely available for .com and .gg
- **VeloQuest**: .com is parked/potentially available; .gg status unknown but likely available
- **RideRealms**: No web presence - likely available for both
- **PedalWarfare**: No web presence - likely available for both
- **StreetFlag**: No web presence - likely available for both

**Action Item:** Check domain availability immediately using a registrar tool, as availability changes rapidly. Consider securing .com, .gg, and .app for chosen name.

## Final Strategic Recommendation

**Primary Recommendation: RouteRivals (#1)**
Strongest market positioning against Zwift and Strava with immediate category clarity.

**Alternative Recommendations:**
- **VeloQuest (#2)** if emphasizing adventure/exploration gaming elements and leveraging cycling heritage
- **RideRealms (#3)** if building for gaming-first audience and creating truly new category identity

## Next Steps

1. Verify domain availability for top 3 choices
2. Check social media handle availability (@routerivals, etc.)
3. Conduct trademark search in target markets
4. Test names with small focus group from target audience
5. Make final decision and secure all relevant domains/handles
