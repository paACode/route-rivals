# RouteRivals Logo Design Prompts

## DALL-E Prompts for Logo Creation

### Main Prompt (Start with this one)

```
A simple, modern logo for "RouteRivals" - a GPS cycling game app. Design features a minimalist bicycle icon merged with competitive gaming elements. The bike silhouette is stylized with clean geometric lines, incorporating a subtle location pin or GPS route path element integrated into the frame. Color scheme: vibrant electric blue (#00D9FF) and energetic orange (#FF6B35) gradient with white accents. The design should be bold, iconic, and instantly recognizable at small sizes. Flat design style, no text, just the icon mark. The logo should suggest movement, competition, and outdoor adventure. Think Nike swoosh simplicity but for cycling competition. Vector-style illustration, professional app icon aesthetic, works well on both light and dark backgrounds. High contrast, sharp edges, symmetrical composition. Suitable for social media profile pictures at 400x400px.
```

### Alternative Variation 1: Route-Focused

```
Minimalist app logo combining a bicycle wheel with a winding GPS route line. The route line forms a dynamic path that integrates with the wheel spokes, suggesting movement and competition. Electric blue and orange gradient color scheme. Flat design, icon-only, no text. Simple geometric shapes, high contrast, works at small sizes. Professional gaming aesthetic meets outdoor sports. Symmetrical, bold, modern. Suitable for app icon and social media profile picture.
```

### Alternative Variation 2: Competition-Focused

```
Simple iconic logo merging a bicycle handlebar silhouette with a competitive flag or finish line element. Stylized cyclist from handlebar perspective with route markers. Bold electric blue and vibrant orange colors. Minimal geometric design, flat illustration style, no text. Gaming-inspired but professional. High contrast for visibility at small sizes. Works on light and dark backgrounds. Modern sports app aesthetic.
```

### Alternative Variation 3: Ultra-Simplified

```
Ultra-minimal logo icon: bicycle frame created from a single continuous GPS route line with a small location pin as the seat. Two-color design: electric blue (#00D9FF) and orange (#FF6B35). Flat vector style, extremely simple, geometric, symmetrical. No text, icon only. Should work at 100x100px size. Professional app icon, gaming aesthetic, outdoor competitive vibe. High contrast, bold lines.
```

## Design Specifications

### Brand Color Palette
- **Primary:** Electric Blue (#00D9FF) - represents GPS/technology
- **Secondary:** Energetic Orange (#FF6B35) - represents competition/energy
- **Accent:** White - for contrast and versatility

### Technical Requirements
- **Format:** Square (1:1 ratio)
- **Optimal generation size:** 1024x1024px
- **Must remain clear and recognizable when scaled to 100x100px**
- **High contrast edges for visibility**

### Style Guidelines
- Flat design (no gradients in shadows, just color gradients)
- Geometric and symmetrical
- Bold line weights (nothing too thin that disappears at small sizes)
- Icon-only (no text in the mark itself)
- 2-3 colors maximum

### Key Visual Elements to Consider
- Bicycle (wheel, handlebar, or simplified frame)
- GPS/route (pin, path line, or map marker)
- Competition (flag, rivalry arrows, or dynamic movement)

## Post-Generation Testing Checklist

Once you generate the logo, validate it against these criteria:

1. **Visibility Test:** Shrink to 100x100px - is it still recognizable?
2. **Background Test:** Place on white, black, and colored backgrounds
3. **Competitor Differentiation:** Compare to Strava (orange) and Zwift (orange/white) - does it stand out?
4. **Versatility:** Could this work as an app icon, favicon, and profile picture?
5. **Brand Alignment:** Does it feel competitive, playful, and outdoor-focused?

## Next Steps After Logo Creation

### Create Logo Variations
- Full color version (primary)
- Single color version (blue only for dark backgrounds)
- White version (for dark backgrounds)
- Black version (for light backgrounds)

### Export Multiple Sizes
- 1024x1024px (master file)
- 512x512px (app stores)
- 180x180px (Apple app icon)
- 192x192px (Android app icon)
- 400x400px (social media optimal)

### File Formats Needed
- PNG with transparency (for versatility)
- SVG vector (for scalability - you may need to recreate)
- JPG with white background (for some platforms)

## Recommendation

Start with the main prompt, but generate 2-3 variations using the alternative prompts. The simplest design that still communicates "cycling + competition" will perform best at small sizes. You can always add complexity later for other brand applications, but nail the simple, iconic profile picture version first.

## Brand Context

**Project:** RouteRivals - GPS-based capture-the-flag cycling game
**Target Audience:** Cycling enthusiasts, Zwift users seeking outdoor alternatives, gamers who cycle
**Brand Personality:** Competitive, playful, inclusive, outdoor-focused
**Positioning:** Live outdoor competitive cycling game (vs Zwift's indoor virtual, vs Strava's asynchronous leaderboards)
